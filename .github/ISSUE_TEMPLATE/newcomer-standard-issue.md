## üåä Cascade Analysis (for refactoring/renaming issues)
<!-- Only fill this section if the issue involves refactoring, renaming, or moving code -->

**Search Terms**: [What strings/patterns to look for in codebase]
- Main term: `[primary_term]`
- Variations: `[PrimaryTerm]`, `[primary_term]`, `[PRIMARY_TERM]`

**Known Locations**:
- [ ] Source code imports and references
- [ ] Configuration files (YAML, JSON, etc.)
- [ ] CI/CD workflows
- [ ] Documentation and comments
- [ ] Database/cache keys
- [ ] Environment variables

**Potential Hidden Dependencies**:
- [ ] String literals in code (not just imports)
- [ ] Build scripts and tooling
- [ ] External integrations or API names
- [ ] File paths in configuration
- [ ] Test fixtures and mock data

**Cascade Impact Estimate**: [Low/Medium/High] - [Estimated # of files affected]

**Recommended Actions**:
- [ ] Run cascade analysis workflow: `gh workflow run cascade-analysis.yml -f search_term='[term]'`
- [ ] Check for case variations and partial matches
- [ ] Verify CI/CD pipeline configurations
- [ ] Plan phased approach if high impact

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific measurable outcome 1
- [ ] Specific measurable outcome 2
- [ ] Build passes without warnings (quick_build_check.sh < 30s)
- [ ] Tests added/updated and passing
- [ ] Theme compliance maintained (100% via detect_violations.py)
- [ ] Voice interface compatibility verified (if UI-related)
- [ ] No merge conflicts with other subtasks

## üé§ Voice-First Considerations
- [ ] Does this feature need voice input support?
- [ ] Are text alternatives provided for voice interactions?
- [ ] Is the UI optimized for voice-first usage patterns?
- [ ] Have you tested with VoiceOver enabled?

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Guide

    var body: some View {
        // Implementation example
        Text("Hello")
            .foregroundColor(Theme.colors.primary) // Use theme colors
    }
}
```
